Improve Patient Experience<\/strong><\/h3><p>Patients expect quick communication and efficient service. A <strong>virtual assistant<\/strong> helps ensure no call goes unanswered and no patient gets lost in the system. They can manage reminders, follow-ups, and even assist with telehealth scheduling. The result? Shorter response times, fewer missed appointments, and a better overall patient experience\u2014all while you focus on delivering care, not paperwork.<\/p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4.
